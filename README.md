# Chat-PA-10

This is a small project I have been working on for my Python class in 2015-2016.

The goal was to develop a simple chat application using built-in python modules (in particular Tkinter) in a short amount of time.
This is what I came up with, it uses a server, any client can connect, chose a username, talk to everyone or send private message, see /help for a list of commands.

Most of the program uses english but there are few comments, variable names and messages in French.
